<h3>Collection and Use of Personal Data</h3>
<p>Zang has long recognized that individuals with whom we conduct business value their privacy. However, in order to conduct global business in this increasingly electronic economy the collection and use of Personal Data is often necessary and desirable for businesses and individuals involved. It is Zang's goal to balance the benefits of our and our customers' business with the right of individuals to prevent the misuse of their Personal Data. Zang aims to collect as little information as possible to protect these individuals' Personal Data.&nbsp;<br><br><strong><em>For what purposes is the Personal Data collected?&nbsp;</em></strong><br><br>Personal Data collected through our Website and / or Solutions may be used for multiple purposes, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>to provide / support / install / configure / update / improve / optimize Solutions you have purchased or requested;</li>
<li>to understand your needs and preferences and to assess your level of satisfaction with Solutions / Website;</li>
<li>to access, store and analyze your information so that you may enjoy Solutions / Website;</li>
<li>to communicate with you about Solutions / Website;</li>
<li>to evaluate the performance and safety of Solutions / Website;</li>
<li>to prevent and detect fraud or misuse of Solutions / Website;</li>
<li>to authenticate users of Solutions / Website;</li>
<li>for marketing purposes and newsletters to the extent permitted by applicable law;</li>
<li>to follow up on any questions and requests for assistance or information;</li>
<li>to maintain internal records;</li>
<li>to comply with legal requirements;</li>
<li>to operate our business.</li>
</ol>
<br><br>
<p><strong><em>What Personal Data is collected?</em></strong>&nbsp;<br><br>We may collect variety of Personal Data that is relevant for the purposes identified in this Privacy Statement. Personal Data may include your name, address, phone number, email address, marketing preferences, login information, or payment card number.&nbsp;<br><br><strong><em>In what way may Personal Data be processed?</em></strong>&nbsp;<br><br>Processing of Personal Data may include using, storing, recording, transferring, adapting, summarizing, amending, sharing, anonymizing and destroying Personal Data as necessary under the circumstances or as otherwise required by law. Once you register with Zang and / or use our Solutions, we will be processing some of your Personal Data.&nbsp;<br><br><strong><em>Who will have access to Personal Data?</em></strong>&nbsp;<br><br>Unless otherwise identified in this Privacy Statement, access to Personal data is limited to Zang employees and / or Contractors (as defined below) who need to have it for the execution of our contractual rights and obligations.&nbsp;<br><br><strong><em>For how long Personal Data will be retained?</em></strong>&nbsp;<br><br>We will retain and use your Personal Data as required to accomplish the purposes for which it was collected or as necessary to resolve disputes, enforce contracts and / or comply with our legal obligations. We may, instead of destroying or erasing your Personal Data, make it anonymous such that it cannot be associated with or tracked back to you. Once data is anonymized � it no longer stands as Personal Data.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<h3>Security of Personal Data</h3>
<p>The security of your Personal Data is important to us. Zang has implemented commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures to aid in protecting Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access. We follow generally accepted standards to protect Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100 % secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<h3>International Data Transfers</h3>
<p>As a global company and provider of Internet-accessible services, Zang may need to transfer Personal Data around the world over public or private networks. As such, Personal Data transfers may naturally include territories outside your country, including outside the European Economic Area (�<strong>EEA</strong>�), where data protection requirements may differ and be less comprehensive than in your country. By using our Website, Solutions or providing any Personal Data to us, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Statement and consent to the processing of such Personal Data outside of your country of residence.</p>
<h3>Disclosure to Third Parties</h3>
<p>For the purposes of (including, but not limited to) operating our business, improving and delivering Solutions, maintaining our Website, sending communications (e.g., marketing) associated with our business and for other commercially reasonable purposes (permitted by applicable law) or otherwise with your consent, we may enter into contractual relationships with third parties including vendors, suppliers, business partners, service providers and other contractors (collectively �<strong>Contractors</strong>�). Please be assured that we select these third parties with the greatest possible care. In addition, Contractors will be contractually bound to commercially reasonable security standards and guidelines regarding the handling of your Personal Data. When using Contractors we may share Personal Data with them which is required to carry out their contract. Zang will exercise reasonable control over the information in order to protect your Personal Data. In some jurisdictions the law also interprets sharing of information within your own company's affiliates / subsidiaries as transfer to a third party. When conducting these sharing operations within our affiliates / subsidiaries, the same security standards and guidelines regarding your Personal Data are met throughout the entire chain of such Zang entities. We may also disclose your Personal Data to third parties in other instances including: (i) as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process; (ii) when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, your safety / the safety of others or defend against legal claims; (iii) to investigate fraud or other illegal activities or violations of Zang�s Terms of Use; (iv) to respond to a government request; (v) in connection with or during negotiation of, any merger, acquisition, sale of all or a portion of our assets, financing, liquidation, reorganization; and (vi) in aggregated and / or anonymized form which can no longer be used to identify you.</p>
<h3>Data Breach</h3>
<p>We employ data protection standards with a view to protecting your Personal Data. Depending on the jurisdiction applicable, we may be obliged by law to inform you and / or relevant data protection authorities about severe breaches of security in our IT network which may affect your Personal Data. Where legally required and possible we will notify you and / or display a notice on our Website / Solutions in case of such a breach.</p>
<h3>Cloud Services</h3>
<p>Most of our Solutions are provided over the public or private networks, hence your Personal Data is stored on servers located globally. Such storage is sometimes referred to as a&nbsp;<em>�cloud service�</em>. Zang is committed to protecting your Personal Data regardless of whether it is stored&nbsp;<em>"in the cloud"&nbsp;</em>or on servers not directly accessible over the Internet. For clarity purposes the assertions made in this Privacy Statement also apply to cloud services. Please also note that some of our Solutions may be hosted on our customers' own servers. Zang may not have access to these servers except if providing maintenance / support or other services. In such event you may contact relevant data controller (e.g.,your employer) for more information about its data processing practices.</p>
<h3>Voice / Video Recordings</h3>
<p>When using our video and conferencing Solutions, you may choose to record audio and / or video data. Such recordings will necessarily include voice and visual Personal Data. Zang only processes this information for the purpose of providing services. If you are concerned about recording, please configure relevant settings of the Solution.</p>
<h3>Fee Based Service</h3>
<p>For all fee-based Solutions we collect Personal Data from you for the purpose of executing and maintaining our contractual relationship. This may include your name, title, contact details (e.g., phone number and e�mail address), payment details (e.g., payment card details or company bank account details), the delivery address. At the point of the conclusion of a contract we set up a customer account in our customer management system(s) which will hold all the information collected. During the duration of our contractual relationship, information such as invoices, payment information and orders will be added to the customer account. We use this information to deliver the ordered Solutions to our customers as well as for billing purposes and to handle payments or resolve disputes.</p>
<h3>Payment Card Data</h3>
<p>Zang may need payment card information in order to process payment for Solutions. This information will also be handled by our payment service providers including Stripe Inc. and all its global subsidiaries and affiliates (more information about privacy in connection with Stripe can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/de/privacy">here</a>). By purchasing our Solutions you consent that our payment service providers will be processing your Personal Data.</p>
<h3>Licensing and Support Tools</h3>
<p>Zang Solutions may include tools that gather information about when and on what hardware the software is installed. Zang uses such information to keep track of whether the installation is in accordance with licenses purchased by our customers as well as to statistically analyze the IT environments in which our products are used or to provide support. In some jurisdictions the information gathered by the licensing tools will be regarded as Personal Data.</p>
<h3>Cookies and Tracking Software</h3>
<p>This information is used for better understanding and improving the effectiveness, performance, functionality and usability of the Website and, most importantly, to help tailor content or offers for you so you could enjoy our services.<br><br><strong><em>Zang</em></strong>&nbsp;<br><br>Our Website may use tracking technologies such as cookies, scripts and tags.&nbsp;<em>"Cookies"</em>&nbsp;are small files that the Website places on your computer's hard drive and / or internet browser for identification purposes.

We do not tie Personal Data to domain information, except where it is necessary to prevent abuse or fraud on our Website.&nbsp;<br><br><strong><em>Third Parties</em></strong>&nbsp;<br><br>Some of our Contractors (e.g., tracking utility services) may use cookies, script, tags, local storage and web beacons on our Website. Our third party tracking utility services company uses a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) that help us better manage content on our Website by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users.

Local storage (HTML5) are used to provide certain features on our Website, to display advertising based on your web browsing activities, and to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5. We partner with a third party ad network to display advertising on our Website and to manage our advertising on other Websites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.

You will continue to receive generic ads.&nbsp;<br><br><strong><em>DNT (Do Not Track)</em></strong>&nbsp;<br><br>We recognize that some people use so called&nbsp;<em>"Do Not Track</em>" cookies while being online in order to prevent websites from collecting the data they leave on the websites and, therefore, prevent them from tracking their online behavior. Zang treats the use of these cookies as if no consent was given for the use of cookies on the Website. In such cases it may be possible that we cannot provide you with access to certain secure parts of our Website.&nbsp;<u>Certain Zang Solutions may use Cookies and Tracking technologies as well. Therefore, assertions made in this section&nbsp;<em>�Cookies and Tracking Software�</em>&nbsp;may apply to our Solutions.
