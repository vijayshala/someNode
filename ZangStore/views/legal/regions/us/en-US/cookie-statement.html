            <h3 id="cookie-what" class='cookie-statement-title'>What Are Cookies and Why Do We Use Them?</h3>

            <p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information, which are downloaded to your device when
                you visit
                a website. As a result, cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit
                to allow
                such website to recognize a user's device (however, cookies cannot read other data of your device's
                hard drive).
                Cookies are used in order to (for example) let you navigate between pages efficiently, remember your
                preferences,
                improve your experience, ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you, as well as to
                provide reporting
                information, etc. By not accepting cookies, some functionalities of our Website may not be accessible.</p>

            <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case Avaya) are called
                <em>"First Party Cookies"</em>. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called
                <em>"Third Party Cookies"</em>. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to
                be provided on
                or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and
                analytics). The
                third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your device both (i) when it visits the
                website
                or service in question and (ii) also when it visits certain other websites or services.</p>

            <p>There are two&nbsp;types of cookies.
                <em>"Persistent Cookies"</em>&nbsp;remain on a user's device for a set period of time specified
                in the cookie. They
                are activated each time that the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.
                <em>"Session Cookies"</em> are temporary. They allow website operators to link the actions of a
                user during a browser
                session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the
                browser
                window. Once the user closes the browser, all session cookies are deleted.</p>

            <p>To the extent that IP addresses or similar identifiers are treated as personal data by local law, we
                also treat these
                indirect identifiers as "Personal Data" (i.e., information that identifies or may identify an
                individual). We
                do not directly tie such Personal Data to the domain information, except where it is necessary to
                enable you to use our Website and / or to prevent
                abuse, fraud on our Website.</p>

            <p id="cookie-tracking" class="cookie-statement-title">Other Tracking Technologies</p>
            <p>We and our third party (e.g., advertising) partners may use other similar technologies from time to
                time, like web
                beacons / web bugs, iframes, scripts, etc. (collectively "Tags"). These are tiny graphics files
                that contain
                a unique identifier that enable us to better manage content on our Website by informing us what content
                is effective,
                to recognise when someone has visited our Website, or (for example, in the case of web beacons) opened
                an e-mail
                that we have sent them (these technologies may record your email address, IP address, date, and time
                associated
                with each delivered/opened email and click for a campaign; we may use this data to create reports about
                how an
                email campaign performed and what actions subscribers took). This also allows us, for example, to
                monitor the
                traffic patterns of users from one page within our Website to another, to deliver or communicate with
                cookies,
                to understand whether you have come to our Website from an online advertisement displayed on a
                third-party website,
                to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve Website performance, and to
                measure the
                success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable
                these Tags,
                in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly (in
                those instances)
                declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.</p>

            <p id="cookie-advertising" class="cookie-statement-title">Targeted Online Advertising</p>
            <p>We may partner with one or more third parties (e.g., advertisers and ad networks, etc.) to display
                advertising on
                our Website and / or to manage and serve advertising on other sites. Advertising and targeting cookies
                are used
                to deliver advertisements more relevant to you, but can also limit the number of times you see an
                advertisement
                and be used to chart the effectiveness of an ad campaign by tracking users' clicks. They are usually
                placed by
                third-party advertising networks with a website operator's permission, but can be placed by the
                operator themselves.
                They can remember that you have visited a website and this information may be shared with other
                companies, including
                other advertisers. The two main ways we use advertising and targeting cookies are set out below:</p>

            <p>
                <span class="cookie-statement-bold">Interest-based Advertising </span>is where cookies are placed on
                your device by our third party service providers,
                which remember your web browsing activity and group together your interests in order to provide you
                with targeted
                advertisements, which may be more relevant to you when you visit our Website. Your previous web
                browsing activity
                can also be used to infer things about you, such as your demographics (e.g., age, gender, etc.). This
                information
                may also be used to make the advertising on our Website more relevant to you.</p>

            <p>
                <span class="cookie-statement-bold">Retargeting </span>is a form of interest-based advertising that
                enables our advertising partners to show you
                advertisements selected based on your online browsing activity away from our Website. This allows
                companies to
                advertise to people who previously visited their website. These cookies will usually be placed on your
                device
                by third-party advertising networks.
